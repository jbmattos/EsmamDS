# EsmamDS
Exceptional Survival Model AntMiner - Diverse Search is an ACO-based Exceptional Model Mining framework to provide straightforward characterisations of subgroups presenting unusual survival models, given by the Kaplan-Meier estimates.
The EsmamDS builds on the Esmam algorithm (https://github.com/jbmattos/ESM-AM_bracis2020) to address the problem of pattern redundancy and provide a more informative and diverse characterisation of survival behaviour.
