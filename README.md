# EsmamDS
**Exceptional Survival Model AntMiner - Diverse Search** is an ACO-based Exceptional Model Mining framework to provide straightforward characterisations of subgroups presenting unusual survival models, given by the Kaplan-Meier estimates.
The EsmamDS builds on the [Esmam](https://github.com/jbmattos/ESM-AM_bracis2020) algorithm to address the problem of pattern redundancy and provide a more informative and diverse characterisation of survival behaviour.
