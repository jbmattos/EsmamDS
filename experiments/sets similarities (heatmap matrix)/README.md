## Analisys of similarity between subgroup sets

The _similarity_ metrics (between pair of subgroups) for description, coverage and model were employed to assess the similarity between the set of subgroups delivered by the EsmamDS and those discovered by each compared approach.
The metrics were computed for all combinations of subgroups in both sets, and the analysis is presented in a heatmap matrix.

The results for the three types of similarity are presented in the files 
```
descriptionSimilarity_baseline-*.pdf
coverageSimilarity_baseline-*.pdf
modelSimilarity_baseline-*.pdf
``` 
where:
- The pages provide the results for each data set;
- In each page, the columns of plots are the EsmamDS results compared with a different algorithm, and the rows are the (30) runs.

In each heatmap matrix, the columns represent the subgroups discovered by the EsmamDS algorithm and the rows are the unique subgroups discovered by the compared approach.
