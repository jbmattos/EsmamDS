## Analysis of subgroup's Survival Models

The `survivalModels_baseline-*.pdf` files present the plots of the Kaplan-Meier models of each subgroup discovered by the compared approaches. 
- The pages provide the results for each data set. 
- In each page, the columns are the results of the different algorithms and the rows are the (30) runs. 
- The colored lines in the plots are the models associated with all discovered subgroups and the dotted line provide the KM model fitted to the whole data set.
